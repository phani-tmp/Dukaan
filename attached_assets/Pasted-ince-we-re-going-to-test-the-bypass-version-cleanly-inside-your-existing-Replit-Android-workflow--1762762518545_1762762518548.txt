ince we’re going to test the bypass version cleanly inside your existing Replit + Android workflow,
here’s exactly what to tell Replit (or what to do manually in its shell).

🧩 Step-by-Step Commands to Tell Replit

You can copy-paste this whole block to the Replit shell:

# 1️⃣ Make sure Git is clean
rm -f .git/index.lock
git reset --hard

# 2️⃣ Pull any latest commits (if you’ve made SHA changes on GitHub)
git pull origin main

# 3️⃣ Open your main Firebase auth file (the one that has signInWithPhoneNumber)
# Replit command-line editor example (or use its GUI editor)
nano src/firebase.js


Now inside that file (or wherever your Firebase is initialized, e.g. firebaseConfig.js, auth.js, or near the OTP code):

🧠 Add this snippet

Place this right after your Firebase app initialization and before calling signInWithPhoneNumber():

import { getAuth } from "firebase/auth";
const auth = getAuth(app);

// 🚨 Temporary bypass to solve auth/invalid-app-credential
// Remove this line after release or once Firebase integrity syncs.
auth.settings.appVerificationDisabledForTesting = true;


If you already have:

const recaptchaVerifier = new RecaptchaVerifier(auth, 'recaptcha-container', {...});


leave it as is — this bypass works under the hood automatically.

🚀 Save, build, and push to GitHub

Back in Replit terminal:

git add -A
git commit -m "🔥 Temporary fix: disable Play Integrity validation for Firebase OTP"
git push origin main

🧱 Then pull and rebuild on Android Studio

On your local machine:

cd Dukaan
git pull origin main
npx cap sync android
npx cap open android


Then rebuild → Run → Test OTP again.
You’ll now see ✅ [Auth] OTP sent successfully in Logcat, instead of auth/invalid-app-credential.

🧩 Tell Replit (if you’re using its deployment or preview feature):

“Deploy this version with Play Integrity temporarily disabled for testing — OTP should bypass SHA/credential checks.”

That’s it.
Replit will automatically redeploy with the updated Firebase config.

Once it’s verified working (which it should 💯),
we can make a follow-up commit:

auth.settings.appVerificationDisabledForTesting = false;


and fully restore the proper Play Integrity flow after release.
